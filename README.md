## WDI Instructor Code Challenge

---

### Yitz Schaffer notes

I added inline comments to the debugged app.rb in the manner I might for
student work.

I put most of the explanations for my incremental feature updates in Git
commit comments. In my industry work, I try to make my code as expressive
as possible; if working with students, I would add comments particularly
when using any common idioms that might not be immediately comprehensible.

Normally I would refactor my code more aggressively, but it seemed like the
code for this task should resemble the original as much as possible,
whether the audience be my prospective-instructor evaluators, or a
student reading sample code or instructor feedback.
